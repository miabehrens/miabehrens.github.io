                            <p>Building Blocks is an open-source exploration of future spaces that is applicable globally and can be manufactured locally. Devising such a concept isn’t without its challenges. A very flexible structure is required to ensure the product can work in the global North as well as in the South. In this article we share some of the thinking that has gone into the design process.</p>

The new church in Sydhavnen must thus accommodate and inscribe itself in a modern and urban context. It must be able to attract part of the population who do not have Christianity as a high priority in their everyday lives, but at the same time also be a Christian refuge for those who have. The main goal for our proposal was to create a church that could join diversity by creating a strong and open community across faith, age, ethnicity, gender etc.</p>

                            <p>Humans has always, to a greater or lesser degree, shaped his surrounding landscape. This is most often done out of necessity or out of the perception we have of nature.
This Thesis project must be seen as a study / demonstration of an architectural, scaleless strategy that wants to test the idea of a new conception of nature
— a motodic tool, which thus works with our perception of nature in a new way where we; humans, is part of an ethical community-circle with nature and animals.
In addition, the strategy articulates how we can work with the concepts; mitigation and adaption and how these two concepts must be understood in together.
<br><br>The purpose of the strategy is not only to be able to inscribe oneself in a single physical context, but to discuss and view the landscape as both a local event and part of a larger global context.
Specifically, the strategy is presented and unfolded in a Danish context, namely Gudenåen, with programmatic functionality and spaciousness in mind.
Here, the project aims to create solutions to the large water rises and caused problems Å system has experienced the last decade.
The new landscape is created through the strategy as a tool and impact is processed on the basis of different themes.
The scaleless strategy is thus used as an architectural method to understand and draw the project forward.</p>
